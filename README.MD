Etch-a-Sketch Challenge from Odin Project


I've completed this challenge with the least features possible at first. That was quite entertaining. My first version was a white box and a button. The mouse hovering was putting rainbow colors from a 0 to 1 opacity each time you was passing over it. 

After that i spent more time, looking at others work and realise that i was able to add more features and that i actually know how to do it. Beside the look or anything i wanted to push myself, test my competences into that project. 

I realise quickly, as simple as it seems, makes everythings work together wasn't that simple. That was the perfect opportunity to came back into old concept and articles in order to make everything works.
