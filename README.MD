Etch-a-Sketch Challenge from Odin Project


I've completed this challenge with the least features possible at first. That was quite entertaining. My first version was a white box with a reset button. The mouse hovering was putting rainbow colors from a 0 to 1 opacity each time you were passing over it. 

After that i spent more time, looking at others work and realise that i was able to add more features and that i actually know how to do it. Beside the look or anything i wanted to push myself, test my competences into that project. 

I realise quickly, as simple as it seems, makes everythings work together wasn't that simple. That was the perfect opportunity to came back into old concept and articles in order to make everything works. I put too much time into that project. But i'm glad i finished it how i wanted it. I could've continue with new idea but i had to make a stop to it. Better stop here to loose myself into a spiral. Hope you'll enjoy it
